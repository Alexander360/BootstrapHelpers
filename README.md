ASP.NET MVC Bootstrap HTML Helpers
==================================

The guys over at Twitter have done a serious favor for developers worldwide with their Bootstrap framework.
This is especially useful for us coders with limited skills in UI design. With the Bootstrap Helpers project
I have made things even easier for the .NET developers.

> **UPDATE:** This project has been superseded by the ExtensoUI package in the [Extenso](https://github.com/gordon-matt/Extenso) project. It does not have all the same helpers, but most of the important ones are there (Accordion, Tabs, Panel, Modal and some smaller things). More importantly is I made it extensible, so you can add your own provider for Bootstrap 4, Foundation 5 or 6, jQueryUI, etc... I have already created a spearate package for Kendo as well. Enjoy.
